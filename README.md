### Project Overview
It provides the e-commerce store with actionable insights toward the optimization of sales, improving customer loyalty, and enhancing operational efficiency. The use of data-driven intelligence in this analysis reveals trends, patterns, and correlations across customer purchase habits, sales performance, and operational metrics.

### Tools
- Excel: Data preparation, Cleaning, and Transformation.
- Power BI: Data visualization, Analysis and Reporting.

### Workflow
#### 1. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The dataset was cleaned and transformed by addressing duplicates, missing values, and date format inconsistencies. It was organized into a table format in Excel, with consistent naming conventions applied to product categories, delivery status, and customer segments. Additional columns were created for date elements (Month, Day, Year, Month Number) and seasonal grouping (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) for trend analysis.
    
#### 2.	Data Loading:
- Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
- Verified the data integrity after loading and applied necessary transformations.
  
#### 3.	Analysis and Visualization:
- Created measures and calculated columns in Power BI to support analysis.
- Visualized trends and patterns using line charts, bar charts, pie chart etc.
